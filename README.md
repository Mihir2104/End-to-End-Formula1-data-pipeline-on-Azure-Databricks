# End-to-End-Formula1-data-pipeline-on-Azure-Databricks
📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an end-to-end cloud-based data engineering pipeline for Formula1 racing datasets, built using Azure Databricks, PySpark, SparkSQL, and Azure Data Factory.

The solution ingests raw CSV and JSON files into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, processes them in Azure Databricks following a Bronze–Silver–Gold layered architecture, and uses Delta Lake features specifically for incremental data loads via MERGE operations to efficiently update datasets without full reloads.

The pipeline is fully automated using Databricks Jobs and Azure Data Factory pipelines, and it delivers analytical insights on driver and constructor performance via Databricks visual dashboards.

🚀 Architecture
1. Data Sources

Ergast API - Formula1 datasets (circuits, races, drivers, results, lap times, pit stops, qualifying, constructors, etc.)

Formats: CSV & JSON (single & multiline)

2. Data Storage – Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Bronze Layer: Raw ingested data

Silver Layer: Cleaned, filtered, and enriched data

Gold Layer: Aggregated, analytics-ready data

3. Data Processing – Azure Databricks

PySpark & SparkSQL for transformations

Schema enforcement & partitioning

Delta Lake MERGE for incremental data loads

Modular functions for ingestion & transformations

4. Orchestration

Databricks Jobs for notebook execution

Azure Data Factory pipelines with triggers & error handling

5. Analytics & Visualization

Aggregations & window functions for KPIs

Databricks dashboards for race trends & performance insights
